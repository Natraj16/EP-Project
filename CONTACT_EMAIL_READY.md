## What You Need to Do

**To activate email sending, you just need to add your SMTP credentials:**

1. **Edit `server/.env`** and replace these placeholder values:
   ```env
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com          # Your actual Gmail
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password             # Your Gmail App Password
   CONTACT_EMAIL=office@pjinfra.com        # Recipient email (already set)
   ```

2. **Get Gmail App Password** (if using Gmail):
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Generate a 16-character app password
   - Paste it into `SMTP_PASS`

3. **Restart your server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

## Alternative: Test Without Real Email

Use **Mailtrap** to test without sending real emails:

1. Sign up at https://mailtrap.io (free)
2. Get your credentials from the dashboard
3. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   SMTP_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
   SMTP_PORT=2525
   SMTP_USER=your-mailtrap-username
   SMTP_PASS=your-mailtrap-password
   CONTACT_EMAIL=office@pjinfra.com
   ```

## Testing the Contact Form

Once configured:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/contact
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Click "Send Message"
4. Check your email inbox (or Mailtrap inbox)

You should receive:
- **At office@pjinfra.com**: Full contact form details
- **At submitter's email**: Confirmation that message was received

## Email Content Preview
