## 📊 Mock Data Structure

The application currently uses mock data for demonstration. Key data structures:

### Request Object
```javascript
{
  id: '1',
  service: 'Security Services',
  category: 'Armed Security',
  status: 'In Progress',
  client: 'ABC Corp',
  email: 'contact@abc.com',
  phone: '+1234567890',
  numberOfPersonnel: 5,
  duration: '3-months',
  startDate: '2025-10-20',
  location: 'Full address',
  shiftType: 'rotating',
  description: 'Detailed description',
  requirements: 'Special requirements',
  budget: '$25-30/hour',
  assignedStaff: 'Staff name',
  timeline: [...],
  messages: [...]
}
```

## 🔄 Backend Integration Points

When connecting to a backend API, you'll need to implement:

1. **Authentication Endpoints**
   - POST `/api/auth/register`
   - POST `/api/auth/login`
   - POST `/api/auth/logout`
   - GET `/api/auth/me`

2. **Client Request Endpoints**
   - GET `/api/client/requests`
   - POST `/api/client/requests`
   - GET `/api/client/requests/:id`
   - POST `/api/client/requests/:id/messages`

3. **Admin Endpoints**
   - GET `/api/admin/requests`
   - GET `/api/admin/requests/:id`
   - PUT `/api/admin/requests/:id`
   - GET `/api/admin/analytics`
   - POST `/api/admin/requests/:id/messages`

4. **File Upload**
   - POST `/api/upload` (multipart/form-data)
