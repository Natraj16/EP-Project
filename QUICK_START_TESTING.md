## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load request details"
- Check backend is running on port 5000
- Verify MongoDB is connected
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify token in localStorage

### "Request not found"
- Ensure the request exists in database
- Check request ID in URL is correct
- Verify you're logged in with correct account

### Timeline not showing updates
- Refresh the page (click View again)
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify admin added a comment when updating
- Check browser console for rendering errors

### Admin login not working
- Verify admin was created: `cd server && npm run create-admin`
- Check credentials exactly: admin@example.co.in / password
- Clear localStorage and try again

## 📚 Documentation

For more detailed information, see:
- **REQUEST_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md** - Complete system documentation
- **TIMELINE_FEATURE_DOCS.md** - Technical details of timeline feature

## 🎯 Key Features

### Timeline System
The timeline allows clients to track request progress:
- Admin updates status → Adds timeline entry with comment
- Client sees all updates in chronological order
- Comments are visible to client
- Timestamps show when each update occurred

### Request Flow
```
Client Creates Request
    ↓
Saved to Database with initial timeline entry
    ↓
Admin views in dashboard
    ↓
Admin updates status + adds comment
    ↓
Timeline entry added to database
    ↓
Client sees update in their timeline
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Browser Showing Old Data
**Solution**: Hard refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Changes Not Saving
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend console for errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Check network tab in browser DevTools
4. Ensure token is valid

### Multiple Clients Not Working
**Solution**:
1. Each client must register separately
2. Use different email addresses
3. Each client sees only their own requests
4. Admin sees all requests

## ✨ Next Steps

After testing the basic flow, try:
1. Create multiple requests from different client accounts
2. Update requests to different statuses
3. Add multiple timeline comments
4. Test all priority levels
5. Try cancelling a request
6. View timeline in different timezones

## 🔐 Security Notes

- JWT tokens used for authentication
- Role-based access control (client vs admin)
- Clients can only view their own requests
- Only admins can update request status
- Timeline updates tracked with updatedBy field
