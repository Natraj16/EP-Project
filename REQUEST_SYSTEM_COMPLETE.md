## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: All requests require valid token
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Clients only see their own requests
- ✅ **Admin Access**: Admins see all requests with client info
- ✅ **Role-Based**: API checks user role before showing data
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Backend validates all request fields
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and loading states

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to submit request"
- ✅ Check backend is running on port 5000
- ✅ Check you're logged in (token in localStorage)
- ✅ Check browser console for errors
- ✅ Check server terminal for errors

### "No requests showing" in dashboard
- ✅ Refresh the page
- ✅ Check network tab in DevTools
- ✅ Verify request was created (check MongoDB or server logs)
- ✅ Make sure you're logged in as correct user

### Admin can't see client requests
- ✅ Make sure user has role: "admin"
- ✅ Check API response in network tab
- ✅ Verify MongoDB has the requests

## 🎊 Success Criteria

**Your system is working if:**

1. ✅ Client can register and login
2. ✅ Client sees empty dashboard initially
3. ✅ Client can create service request via multi-step form
4. ✅ Request appears immediately in client dashboard
5. ✅ Stats update automatically (Total, Pending, etc.)
6. ✅ Admin can see the request in admin dashboard
7. ✅ Admin sees client details (name, email, company)
8. ✅ Logout/Login persists all data
9. ✅ Data saved permanently in MongoDB

## 📊 Test with PowerShell

You can test the API directly:

```powershell
# Create a test client and request
.\test-request-flow.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Register a client
2. Create a service request
3. Verify it appears in client view
4. Register an admin
5. Verify admin can see the request
6. Show all details

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that requests are flowing, you can:

1. **Request Details Page**: Create full view for single request
2. **Status Updates**: Allow admin to change request status
3. **Assignment**: Allow admin to assign requests to staff
4. **Comments**: Add conversation thread to requests
5. **Notifications**: Email alerts for status changes
6. **File Uploads**: Allow clients to attach documents
7. **Analytics**: Dashboard charts and graphs
